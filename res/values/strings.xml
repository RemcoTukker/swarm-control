    <!-- About Dialog -->
    <string name="about_general">  
        SwarmControl is developed at Distributed Organisms or DO bots. DO researches,
        develops, and maintains robotic swarms. DO is a daughter company of the Dutch 
        research company Almende B.V. 
        
        This Android app will be appended over the course of time to showcase remote
        control of a wide variety of commercial-off-the-shelf robots. Moreover, it will
        demonstrate group functionality in due time.
          
        Please, realize that most of our swarm solutions use more dedicated robots. See 
        for example http://www.fireswarm.nl for one of our projects, where UAVs are used
        to find fire for the fire brigade.
